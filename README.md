# PYTHON 3 TUTORIAL


This is a tutorial I made for myself as I was learning Python. I improved it for my friends who want to learn Python
as well and I figured I might as well share it with others.

While the official Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) provided valuable information,
many questions would have been left unanswered without the Stackoverflow community (https://stackoverflow.com/).
